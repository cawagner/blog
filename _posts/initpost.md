I've decided to restart my blog after about a year and a half of complete inactivity. This time around, I'll mostly be focusing my energies writing about things that I will forget how to do later and will need to look up somewhere -- in a sense, my target audience is my future self.

That is exactly why I'm kicking the new blog off with a picture of my cat.
