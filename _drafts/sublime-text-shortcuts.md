I use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as my primary text editor because a lot of my time is split between Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, and I am far too lazy to learn to use different editors depending on where I happen to be sitting.

That having been said, when I've been using a non-Sublime Text enviornment my capacity to forget shortcut keys is really quite impressive. These are a few that I find myself forgetting frequently:

- &#8984;&#8679;+Space -- Expand selection to string / brackets
-
